# Data Science job offers analysis

## Introduction

We aim to collect and analysis Data Scientist job offers and extract the top demaned skills. 

## Authors

* [William Guesdon](https://github.com/wguesdon)

## ToDo List

```
. List job boards offering an API -> William
. Look into web scraping tools available for site without an API -> William
. Collect open sources datasets
. Look into examples of text analysis in Python (Spacy)
```

## Dataset

* A dataset of 1K Data Science jobs offers was collected. 

## Structure of the repository

#### methods/
Contains the instruction to set up the environment.

#### notebooks/
Contains the notebooks used for 
* EDA.
* Resizing the dataset.
* experimenting with ML models.

#### src/
Contains the libraries built to  build the training set, train final ML models.

#### dev/
Directory to be used for development. Each of the authors having one folder to upload scripts and notebooks in development.

#### file-tree structure/
